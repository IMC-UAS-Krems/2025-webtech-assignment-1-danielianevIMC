                    <p><b>Profile</b></p>
                    <p>I am Daniel Ianev, born in 2004 in Sofia, Bulgaria. A driven and goal-oriented
                        individual, I have consistently developed my leadership and interpersonal skills,
                        particularly through my experience as a prefect at the Deutsche Internationale
                        Schule Johannesburg. In this role, I strengthened my ability to manage teams,
                        communicate effectively, and handle responsibility with discipline and respect.
                        My background as both a leader and an athlete has instilled in me a strong
                        work ethic, adaptability, and a commitment to teamwork. These qualities have
                        prepared me to excel in dynamic and fast-paced environments where quick
                        thinking and collaboration are essential. I am focused on personal growth,
                        continuous improvement, and making a meaningful contribution to any
                        organization or team I am part of.

                                 both on and off the pitch. Beyond the field, I engage with fans and the community through outreach programs and public appearances, representing 
                                 Liverpool with professionalism and passion.
