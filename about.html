                            of my time spent gaming was on fifa, call of duty and fortnite. When it comes to socialising, going out and having fun with my friends,
                            having some drinks and doing what we like to do is peak bromance. Epic.

                    <p>There are many sports that I enjoy. Football would be my favourite and what I consider myself best at. 
                        I have played football for most of my life, tennis for around 9 years, table tennis around 10 years and I started working about around age 16.
                        Tennis, table tennis and gym are my other go-tos when it comes to physical activities.
